      <h3 class="projects__intro--summary">
        The term smart home could mean many different things to many different people. Some believe that having Netflix on their
        TV is a sophisticated smart home interaction while some dream of fully-automated houses catering to their every need.
        Regardless, the smart home space has become increasingly difficult to ignore. Yet despite this, there are relatively
        few applications that have achieved widespread adoption. The question then becomes - how can we bridge the gap between
        the product and the consumer?

          The proposal
        </h2>
        <p class="u-padBot">
          Simplicity and unobtrusiveness were key factors in the development of Bundl. As the amount of available smart home devices
          grow, management of these devices becomes more and more complex. The potential users that we spoke to were not
          concerned with total control. The value they found was in peace of mind, knowing these devices were actively monitoring
          their home and ensuring that everything runs smoothly. We focused our efforts into providing an experience that
          made certain assumptions about what would be optimal for the user based on their interactions with the platform.
          The user is also given contextual information on their utility use to demonstrate that they can make a tangible
          change when using Bundl.
        </p>

        <h2 class="projects__container--subtitle">
          Who's out there?
        </h2>
        <p>
          In order to determine how existing users use their smart home technology or if they use it at all, we conducted a total of
          12 informational interviews. There was emphasis placed on the types of technology that the user owns currently
          and the decision making process that went into that purchase. We were also interested in their knowledge of the
          smart home space and their immediate reaction when they hear the term “smart home”.
        </p>
        <p>
          After several rounds of analyzing our insights through the process of affinity mapping, we observed three emerging patterns:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li class="item--highlight">Users that claim to be tech-savvy found smart home devices to be gimmicky and could not find an appropriate use
            case for them.</li>
          <li class="item--highlight">Renters place less emphasis on investing in their non-permanent homes while homeowners place security over other
            factors including costs.
          </li>
          <li class="item--highlight">Users value simple interactions.

          Narrowing our focus
        </h2>
        <p>
          Based on our initial research, we knew that our target user would have the three traits listed above. With this is mind,
          how can we make a product that provides the busy professional with a quick and simple way to make use of his smart
          home devices so he can spend his time on the more important things in life? Before we could answer that specific
          question, we defined four design principles by which we would judge our decisions moving forward:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li class="item--highlight">Utilitarian
            <br>
            <span>Our ideal user believes that devices are tools, not toys and values products that solve a tangible problem.</span>
          </li>
          <li class="item--highlight">Intrude only when important
            <br>
            <span>The user values free time and does not want to be interrupted unnecessarily.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li class="item--highlight">Accessible on the go
            <br>
            <span>Our data suggests that the app would likely be used most when away from home on a mobile platform and therefore
              should be design in a way that would facilitate this.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li class="item--highlight">Anticipate, don’t ask
            <br>
            <span>In order to reduce the mental load on a busy user, the app should make certain inferences on optimal settings.
            </span>
          </li>
        </ul>

          Refining the foundation
        </h2>
        <p>With the user and design principles defined, further work needed to be done to continue to refine designs in order
          to make sure we were addressing the correct issues. Testing consisted of in-person and remote interviews with potential
          users who fit our user profile. Initially, the testing was done through paper prototypes but as we received more
          information, the prototypes were presented in higher fidelity formats such. This exercise allowed us to have a
          clearer idea of the mental models of the typical user and how they would react to certain interactions.

        <p class="projects--highlight">Key insights</p>

        <ul>
          <li class="item--highlight">Onboarding should involve set up
            <br>
            <span>If the onboarding process was not interactive then testers tend to ignore the information given. If some degree
              of set up was included in onboarding the tested was more engaged in the process.</span>
          </li>
          <li class="item--highlight">Devices over rooms
            <br>
            <span>The idea of categorizing connected devices through rooms was generally confusing for the tester. They would rather
              see the individual devices directly.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li class="item--highlight">Avoid scrolling when possible
            <br>
            <span>Testers were confused by excess scrolling on the home page and would often miss critical features because they
              were not visible on screen.
            </span>
          </li>

      <h3 class="projects__outro--summary">
        Ultimately, our solution was based on a dashboard that was cognitively simple and relied on a device-first methodology which
        we had been exploring throughout the process. Our goal from the start was to provide the user with an experience
        that is simple and clear. Smart home technology can mean many things and it was easy for us to go too far when providing
        control for the user. We believed that our primary person was more interested in keeping the status quo rather than
        spending too much time on complicated processes. The result was an app that is streamlined and is only used when
        it is needed. This was done primarily with simple iconography, clear typography and a structure of organization that
        put devices first.

          a BFA Architecture degree and I'm always looking for new ways to approach and solve design challenges. My philosophy
          in design stems from my background of living in various countries around the world - I believe that design should
          be inclusive, flexible and culturally relevant. Design should take into account not only aesthetic principles but
          also social principles - aware of its context and affect on society at large. Only when there is a balance between
          the user, culture and design can challenges be overcome.</p>
